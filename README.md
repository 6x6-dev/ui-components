# UI Components
create a UI component library for use on a website

## Requirements

- a developer can use a selection of elements (at least four)
- elements have a sane set of default behaviors and styles
- package should be available through npm or a similar 

## Notes

[Ant Design](https://ant.design/) and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) are both great examples of **large** libraries that cover almost every need a developer might have building a web app or website. This exercise shouldnt try to cover too many use cases. While building this keeping [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) concepts in mind will help keep things organized. [UI Kit](https://github.com/uikit/uikit) is a good example along with [Belle](https://github.com/nikgraf/belle). Focusing on doing a few things well will go a long way over trying to cover all bases. Something that accomplished that sharp focus is [React Select](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select).
